# USER STORY FOR COACH
AS A lifting coach
I WANT an application to conveniently have access to all my coaching tasks
SO THAT I will not have to switch between multiple apps for a singular client

WHEN I log in
THEN I should be able to see my roster of clients
WHEN I click on a single client
THEN I should be able to get to the client's page
WHEN I am on the client's page
THEN I should be able to upload/update a new block (schedule) for the client, and leave feedback for client's uploaded videos



# USER STORY FOR CLIENT
AS A lifting client
I WANT an application to conveniently have access to my programming, and upload my videos for my coach
SO THAT I won't have to use multiple applications to check programs, send videos, and read my feedback.

WHEN I log in (w/ coach code)
THEN I should be able to see my profile
WHEN my coach uploads my block
THEN I should be able to see my block, along with all the excercises
WHEN I complete my excercises
THEN I should be able to upload details on all my sets with their weights onto the uploaded block (editable table)
WHEN I complete my primary days
THEN I should be able to upload a video of my sets onto their respective spots on the block for my coach to see and leave me feedback.
